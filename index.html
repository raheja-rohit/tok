    <h1>TOK For Subject Teachers - Cat 3</h1>
    <p>Shiv Nadar School - 3-4 October 2024</p>
</div>

<!-- Sample Content -->
<div class="container my-5">
    <h1>Overall Purpose of the Workshop</h1>
	<p>This workshop explores the key elements of the theory of knowledge (TOK) curriculum from the perspective of how those elements relate to, and can be integrated into, subject teaching. Participants will understand that they play an important role supporting TOK, and that in turn TOK plays an important role enriching and supporting their subjects.</p>
	<p>This workshop will provide you with the opportunity to:</p>
	<ul>
    	<li>Reflect on yourself, the teachers, as knowers</li>
    	<li>Consider the link between TOK and inquiry</li>
    	<li>Discuss the elements of the knowledge framework and their applicability to the different subject areas</li>
    	<li>Incorporate practical understanding of the role of knowledge questions and how to explore them in the subject areas</li>
    	<li>Investigate and develop activities in order to integrate TOK into your lessons</li>
	</ul>

    <h1>Why integrate TOK in DP Subjects?</h1>
	<p><b>Diploma Programme: From principles into practice – April 2015</b></p>
	<p>TOK is a course that encourages reflection on the nature of human knowledge and should be taught with reference to student experience in the classroom, which requires concurrency of learning. (Pg. 49)</p>
	<p>Planning time must include discussions involving differentiation, learning support, TOK integration, learner profile development and international mindedness. (Pg. 55)</p>
	<p>Planning horizontally will involve teachers of the same year level working together between and within subject areas to plan the scope of learning in a particular year. This planning includes the integration of TOK in each subject. (Pg. 55)</p>
	<p>The theory of knowledge (TOK) experience provides a forum for discussion and instruction that supports the development of interdisciplinary understanding. It is essential that the academic disciplines make explicit reference to TOK questions. (Pg. 57)</p>
	<p>The most important curricular tool through which students make connections between their individual subject disciplines is through the study of the TOK course. The TOK course plays a special role in the DP by providing an opportunity for students to reflect on the nature of knowledge, and to make connections between different areas of knowledge. …… TOK supports the development of interdisciplinary understanding by providing a discussion forum about the nature of knowledge and the similarities and differences in the ways that knowledge is gained in different disciplines. Links to TOK are identified in all DP subject guides, and all DP teachers are encouraged to help students to identify TOK knowledge questions in their subject lessons. (Pg. 61)</p>
	<p><b>Approaches to Teaching and Learning in Diploma Programme</b></p>
	<p>It is intended that the study of TOK will support, and also be supported by, the academic disciplines, and all DP subject guides provide teachers with suggestions for how they can make links to TOK in their subject.</p>
	<p>Teaching idea: As part of their TOK course, DP students compare and contrast the methods used to gain knowledge in different areas (such as the natural sciences, history or the arts). Initiate a discussion with your students about the methods used in your DP subject. What are the methods used in your subject, and what is it about these methods that generates knowledge? What are the assumptions underlying these methods? What are the limitations/constraints on these methods? (Pg. 4)</p>
	<p><b>TOK Teacher support material</b></p>
	<p>It is intended that TOK should support, and be supported by, the rest of the programme.</p>
	<p>Subject teachers do not need to “teach” the TOK course in their subject lessons.</p>
	<p>However, they play a crucial role in helping students to make connections to TOK across the curriculum and in helping to reinforce the development of the skills and dispositions that the TOK course seeks to develop in students.</p>
